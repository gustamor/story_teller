# Ai Story Teller
Template for a Flutter Application with ChatGPT and DALL-E Integration


## About The Project
Welcome to an innovative Flutter application, designed to captivate both users and tech enthusiasts alike. This app uniquely combines AI-driven storytelling through ChatGPT and artistic image generation via DALL-E. Aimed at bridging the gap between technology and creativity, it's structured into data, domain, and UI layers. The architecture not only demonstrates best practices but also showcases a sophisticated blend of design patterns. The standout feature is the integration of the Abstract Factory and Bridge patterns, optimizing widget creation for both Android and iOS platforms. It's a testament to my commitment to excellence and innovation in app development.

## Built With
- Flutter
- Firebase
- OpenAI APIs (ChatGPT & DALL-E)

## Getting Started
To use this app, developers need to configure Firebase and the OpenAI API. Here's a quick guide on setting up the necessary parameters:

- **OpenAI Key & Organization**: Retrieve your OpenAI key and organization details using Firebase Remote Config.
- **Image Quality & GPT Model Configuration**: Adjust the image quality and GPT model parameters as needed.
- **DALL-E Model**: Configure the DALL-E model through a JSON object obtained from Firebase Remote Config.

Get a local copy up and running, follow these simple steps.

### Prerequisites
This project requires Flutter installed on your machine. Ensure you have the latest version by running:
```sh 
flutter --version
```

### Installation
1. Clone the repo
    ```sh 
    git clone [repository URL]
    ```
2. Install Flutter packages
    ```sh 
    flutter pub get
    ```
3. Set up Firebase in your Flutter project.
    - Follow the instructions at Firebase Flutter Setup to integrate Firebase.
4. Configure OpenAI API keys in Firebase Remote Config.
    - Set up Remote Config in your Firebase project.
    - Add the following parameters to Remote Config:
        - openAiKey
        - openAiOrganization
        - jpq_quality
        - gtp_model
        - gtp_prompt
        - dalle


## Configuration
In your Flutter application, set the Remote Config parameters as follows:
```dart 
Params.oakey = await remoteConfig.getStringValue("openAiKey");
Params.oaorg = await remoteConfig.getStringValue("openAiOrganization");
Params.jpgQuality = await remoteConfig.getIntValue("jpq_quality");
Params.gptModel = await remoteConfig.getStringValue("gtp_model");
Params.gptPrompt = await remoteConfig.getStringValue("gtp_prompt");
final dalleRemote = await remoteConfig.getStringValue("dalle");
Params.dalleModel = DalleModel.fromMap(json.decode(dalleRemote));
```
## Special Feature: GPT Prompt Format
One of the key aspects of this app is its use of OpenAI's ChatGPT to generate compelling stories. To ensure seamless integration and optimal performance, the GPT prompts in the app require a specific JSON format. Here's a brief overview for developers:

- **Title**: Represents the title of the story. It's concise yet descriptive.
- **Story**: The main narrative body generated by ChatGPT.
- **Prompt**: The initial input given to ChatGPT to generate the story.

Example JSON Structure for GPT Prompts
```json
{
  "title": "The Adventure Begins",
  "story": "Once upon a time, in a land far away...",
  "prompt": "Generate a image about a forgotten kingdom."
}
```
## Usage
This application allows users to generate and view AI-powered stories and images. The main features include:

- Story generation using ChatGPT.
